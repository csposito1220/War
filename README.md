Player Turn:

Each player will flip the top card of their deck and place it in the center between the players.  This is accomplished by clicking the player deck

Check Winner of the Round:

The player will click the blue Check Winner Chip.  This will see who's card has the higher, then both of the cards are moved into the winner's deck.  The deck counter chip is updated.

# Future Plans

I plan to add animations of the cards moving from the deck to the middle and then back again.


# Challenging Challenge

This was a peice of challenging code.  I was having trouble getting the function to get the value of the selected card to determine the winner.
